All views expressed here are solely mine and do not represent those of my employer or anyone else.

## About Me

I am the Executive Director of Information and Evaluation for Santa Rosa City Schools.

I received a doctorate in Educational Studies from the University of Michigan, where I was a predoctoral fellow in the IES training program in Causal Inference in Educational Policy Research (CIEPR). I was also a postdoctoral research associate in education policy at the Annenberg Institute at Brown University.

I grew up in Italy. I earned a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from the Università degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia, and a Master of Arts in Education and a teaching credential from California State University, Los Angeles. I also worked as an instructional coach and middle and high school mathematics teacher in Los Angeles and Lodi, California, for five years.

I use the pronouns he/him/his.
