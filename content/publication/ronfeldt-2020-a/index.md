abstract: New studies show that the instructional effectiveness of preservice candidates
  and their cooperating teachers are positively related. However, we neither know
  if these relationships are causal nor, assuming they are, if it is possible to significantly
  increase the instructional effectiveness of the cooperating teacher pool. In this
  study, we randomly assign districts to receive recommendation lists (generated using
  administrative data) for the recruitment of more promising cooperating teachers.
  Districts receiving lists recruited significantly more effective/experienced cooperating
  teachers, while candidates placed in these districts felt significantly better prepared
  to teach. As a result, this study offers an innovative, low-cost strategy for recruiting
  effective/experienced cooperating teachers and presents the first causal estimates
  that more effective/experienced cooperating teachers improve candidates' preparedness
  to teach.
