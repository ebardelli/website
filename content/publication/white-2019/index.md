abstract: 'Value-added (VA) scores signal teacher quality and are designed to be used,
  with other data, to make employment decisions. However, this usefulness is hampered
  by: 1) their normative nature, which promotes competition among teachers, 2) their
  difficulty to interpret and incorporate with other data, which makes using VA scores
  as one data source among many difficult, and 3) a lack of trust in scores. We show
  how to create (model-based) non-normative and more interpretable VA scores, which
  winds up being a simple rescaling of traditional VA scores. Our approach more closely
  links VA scores to data-based decision making efforts and enables the creation of
  clear and objective criterion of effectiveness for teachers.'
