abstract: 'The investigation at scale of the tensions that teachers need to manage
  when deciding to follow recommendations for practice has been hampered by the problem
  of occurrence: The conditions in which those decisions could be made need to occur
  during an observation in order for observers to document how teachers handle them.
  Simulations have been recommended as a way to immerse teachers in instructional
  contexts in which they have the opportunity to follow such recommendations and observe
  what teachers choose to do in response. In this article, we show an example of how
  a teaching simulation may be used to support such investigation, in the context
  of policy recommendations to open up classroom discussion and consider multiple
  solutions and in the instructional situation of doing proofs in geometry. A contrast
  between the decisions made by expert and novice teachers (n = 59) in the simulation,
  analyzed using multiple regression, adds empirical evidence to earlier conjectures
  based on qualitative analysis of classroom teaching experiments that revealed teachers
  to be particularly attentive to epistemological and temporal constraints. We found
  that expert and novice teachers differed in how likely they were to prefer practices
  recommended by policymakers. Specifically, expert teachers were significantly more
  likely than novice teachers to open up classroom discussions when they had the knowledge
  resources to correct a student error. Similarly, expert teachers were significantly
  more likely than novice teachers to explore multiple solutions when there were no
  time constraints.'
