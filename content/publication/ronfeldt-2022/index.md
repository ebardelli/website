abstract: Despite their critical role in the preparation of pre-service teachers,
  very little research has explored the impacts of offering mentors professional development
  around how to coach and support their candidates. We c onduc t an e va lu at i on
  of a professional development opportunity offered by the state of Tennessee to randomly
  assigned mentors at six different programs over the course of three years, investigating
  its impacts on the perceptions and practices of both the mentors themselves and
  their candidates. We f i nd t hat professi ona l de vel opment i nc re as es mentors'
  frequency of coaching and mentors' own instructional effectiveness, particularly
  in emphasized areas, as well as candidates' employment rates, highlighting the potential
  of mentor professional development to improve the clinical placement experience
  as a whole.
