abstract: The clinical teaching experience is one of the most important components
  of teacher preparation. Prior observational research has found that more effective
  mentors and schools with better professional climates are associated with better
  preparation for teacher candidates. We test these findings using an experimental
  assignment of teacher candidates to placement sites in two states. Candidates who
  were randomly assigned to higher quality placement sites experienced larger improvements
  in performance over the course of the clinical experience, as evaluated by university
  instructors. The findings suggest that improving clinical placement procedures can
  improve the teaching quality of candidates.
