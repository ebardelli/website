abstract: For decades, federal and state agencies have identified teacher shortages
  in high-needs areas (HNAs), including science, mathematics, and special education,
  as a critical problem. Many states have implemented policies and practices to recruit
  HNA endorsed teachers, but little is known about how their workforce outcomes compare
  with other teachers. Leveraging statewide longitudinal data in Tennessee, we observe
  that the number of teachers who receive HNA endorsements has increased over time
  even as the overall number of teachers prepared in the state has declined. HNA teachers
  are employed at higher rates and retained at similar rates as other teachers. HNA
  teachers have similar student achievement gains as non-HNA teachers. Though HNA
  and non-HNA teachers also have similar first-year observation ratings, STEM and
  special education teachers improve at slower rates subsequently. Overall, findings
  suggest that efforts in Tennessee to recruit, prepare, and retain teachers with
  HNA endorsements have mostly been successful.
