abstract: Critical consciousness represents the analysis and critique of structural
  inequalities, the motivation and perceived capacity to effect change, and social
  action to redress inequity. A wave of recent instruments measuring critical consciousness
  has been rigorously validated. Yet, whether these measures efficiently assess different
  levels of critical consciousness or contain redundant, or non-informative, items
  remain unknown. This research develops a short version (Short CCS, or ShoCCS) of
  the previously validated Critical Consciousness Scale. Using Item Response Theory
  methods, the long-form CCS is scrutinized for redundant items to efficiently measure
  critical reflection, critical motivation, and critical action. The resulting 13-item
  ShoCCS yields an internally consistent instrument with similar information distributions
  as the longer measure. Since the ShoCCS places less financial and time burden on
  investigators and respondents in comparison to the original CCS, and includes a
  new measure of critical motivation, it may streamline CC measurement in scholarship,
  practice, and policy.
