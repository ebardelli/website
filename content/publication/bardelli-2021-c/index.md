abstract: Many prior studies have examined whether there are average differences in
  levels of teaching effectiveness among graduates from different teacher preparation
  programs (TPPs); other studies have investigated which features of preparation predict
  graduates' average levels of teaching effectiveness. This is the first study to
  examine whether there are average differences between TPPs in terms of graduates'
  average growth, rather than levels, in teaching effectiveness, and to consider which
  features predict this growth. Examining all graduates from Tennessee TPPs from 2010
  to 2018, we find meaningful differences between TPPs in terms of both levels and
  growth in teaching effectiveness. We also find that different TPP features, including
  areas of endorsement, program type, clinical placement type and length, program
  size, and faculty composition explain part of these differences. Yet, the features
  that predict initial teaching effectiveness are not the same features that predict
  growth.
