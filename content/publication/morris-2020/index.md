abstract: Educator preparation programs (EPPs) across Tennessee train teacher candidates
  through a combination of coursework and practice teaching experiences. These practice
  experiences pair pre-service teachers with current teachers in their endorsement
  areas who are known as clinical mentors. This brief examines whether having a more
  instructionally effective clinical mentor matters, and what the state, districts,
  and EPPs can do to ensure that student teaching experiences ready future teachers.
