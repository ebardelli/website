abstract: Growing evidence suggests that preservice candidates receive better coaching
  and are more instructionally effective when they are mentored by more instructionally
  effective cooperating teachers (CTs). Yet teacher education program leaders indicate
  it can be difficult to recruit instructionally effective teachers to serve as CTs,
  in part because teachers worry that serving may negatively impact district evaluation
  scores. Using a unique data set on over 4,500 CTs, we compare evaluation scores
  during years these teachers served as CTs with years they did not. In years they
  served as CTs, teachers had significantly better observation ratings and somewhat
  better achievement gains, though not always at significant levels. These results
  suggest that concerns over lowered evaluations should not prevent teachers from
  serving as CTs.
