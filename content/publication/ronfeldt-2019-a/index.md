abstract: Prior work suggests that recent graduates from teacher education programs
  feel better prepared to teach and are more instructionally effective when they learned
  to teach with more instructionally effective cooperating teachers. However, we do
  not know if these relationships are causal. Even if they are, we do not know if
  it is possible to recruit cooperating teachers who are, on average, significantly
  more effective than those currently serving. This paper describes an innovative
  strategy to use historical administrative on teachers to recommend the most instructionally
  effective teachers in various districts and subject areas to serve as cooperating
  teachers. In collaboration with a large teacher education program, partnering districts
  were randomized to receive either recommendation lists or use business-as-usual
  approaches. Those districts that received recommendations recruited significantly
  and meaningfully more effective and experienced cooperating teachers. Additionally,
  preservice student teachers who learned to teach in these same districts felt significantly
  better prepared to teach. This study offers an innovative and low-cost strategy
  for recruiting effective and experienced cooperating teachers and presents some
  of the first evidence that learning to teach with instructionally effective cooperating
  teachers has a causal impact on feelings of preparedness to teach.
