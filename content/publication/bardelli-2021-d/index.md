abstract: For decades, federal and state agencies have identified teacher shortages
  in high-needs endorsement areas (HNEAs), including science, mathematics, and special
  education, as a critical problem. Many states have implemented policies and practices
  to recruit HNEA endorsed teachers, but little is known about how their workforce
  outcomes compare with other teachers. Leveraging statewide longitudinal data in
  Tennessee, we observe that the number of teachers who receive HNEA endorsements
  has increased over time even as the overall number of teachers prepared in the state
  has declined. HNEA teachers are employed at higher rates and retained at similar
  rates as other teachers. HNEA teachers have similar student achievement gains as
  nonHNEA teachers. Though HNEA and non-HNEA teachers also have similar first-year
  observation ratings, STEM and special education teachers improve at slower rates
  subsequently. Overall, we offer suggestive evidence that efforts in Tennessee to
  recruit, prepare, and retain teachers with HNEA endorsements have mostly been successful.
