abstract: Growing evidence suggests that preservice candidates receive better coaching
  and are more instructionally effective when they are mentored by more instructionally
  effective cooperating teachers (CTs). Yet, teacher education program leaders indicate
  it can be difficult to recruit instructionally effective teachers to serve as CTs,
  in part because teachers worry that serving may negatively impact district evaluation
  scores. Using a unique dataset on over 4,500 CTs, we compare evaluation scores during
  years these teachers served as CTs to years they did not. In years they served as
  CTs, teachers had significantly better observation ratings and somewhat better achievement
  gains, though not always at significant levels. These results suggest that concerns
  over lowered evaluations should not prevent teachers from serving as CTs.
